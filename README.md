## About Me! 
### Hi there 👋


My name is Beatriz, and I'm a current 3rd-year student at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Design and Interaction as well as an International Business double major. I'm mainly interested in digital advertisement and human-computer design, with a minor interest in analytical marketing. I'm well versed in Adobe programs, Figma, and Python. My multicultural and diverse linguistic background has also influenced my design process and marketing campaigns. 

Checked out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/beatrizchenm/) to connect and my [Portfolio](https://rosettarietastone.my.canva.site/bchenmai) to see some cool things I've created!
